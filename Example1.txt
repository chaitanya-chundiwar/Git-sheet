What is a branching strategy?

Branches are primarily used as a means for teams to develop features giving them a separate workspace for their code. These branches are usually merged back to a master branch upon completion of work. In this way, features (and any bug and bug fixes) are kept apart from each other allowing you to fix mistakes more easily.
This means that branches protect the mainline of code and any changes made to any given branch donâ€™t affect other developers.
A branching strategy, therefore, is the strategy that software development teams adopt when writing, merging and deploying code when using a version control system.
